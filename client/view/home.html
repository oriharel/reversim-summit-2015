      <h4>Topics</h4>
      <p>
        You may get a good sense of the topics we're interested in by looking into previous events: <a href='http://summit2013.reversim.com'>Reversim Summit 2013</a> and <a href='http://summit2014.reversim.com'>Reversim Summit 2014</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from that, here's a good grocery list of topics just to give you ideas.
        We're interested in everything including software development,
        software product development, UX, startups mobile, web, devops,
        data processing, scaling and more.
        You should know - this is not a closed list, if your topic doesn't seem to fit here
        and is of general interest, we want it!
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not set out a predefined list of tracks. We would like to leave the
        topics (tracks) open and only after accepting the submissions we might devide up to tracks, but we shall not rule out a single good talk just b/c it's not a natural fit to any of the predefined list, so don't worry so much about categorizing your submissions.

      <h4>Full Featured talks</h4>
      <p>
        Full feature are frontal presentations b/w 30 - 40 minutes. They will be held in either the large room (300 ppl) or the small room (100 ppl) in two parallel sessions
      </p>
      <h4>Lightning Talks</h4>
      <p>
        Lightning are speedy 5 min talks. They will be presented in a series in which each presenter has exactly 20 slides, 15 sec per slide, slides are auto advanced and in total 5 min. No break b/w the sessions. It's fun, it's speedy, it's consice and it's breathtaking :-)
      </p>
      <h4>Open Space</h4>
      <p>
        Open space is a free form discussion in which folks gather around a tables or just in circles and discuss a topic of common interest.
        There's no need to submit anything before the conference, just think of topics that interest you and
        suggest them for voting at the conference itself.
        We will hold a few parallel tracks of open spaces in which each space will revolve around one chosen topic.
      </p>
      <h4>Open Source in Israel</h4>
      <p>
        We are especially interested in open source projects made in israel or created
        by Israelis. We will have a special stage for that.
